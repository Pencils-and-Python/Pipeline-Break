    "# Predicting Pipe Breaks with Machine Learning: A Civic Infrastructure Case Study\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Roadmap\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 1: Initial Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load Syracuse water main break dataset.\n",
    "* Identify available columns: location, break type, date/time.\n",
    "* Note major missing features: pipe material, diameter, age, depth, soil type, pressure zone, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 2: Problem Reframing\n",
    "\n",
    "* Recognize that the lack of critical pipe metadata limits traditional supervised ML.\n",
    "* Reframe project goal from pipe-level prediction to **spatial risk classification**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * \"Where are the break-prone zones based on what we *can* observe?\"\n",
    "  * Focus on location-based analysis and external enrichment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 3: Data Enrichment Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add contextually relevant features from public sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Approximate infrastructure age from parcel/building data.\n",
    "  * Soil characteristics from USDA/NRCS Soil Survey.\n",
    "  * Freeze/thaw weather patterns from NOAA datasets.\n",
    "  * Zoning or land-use type.\n",
    "* Engineer categorical features and proxies where direct data is unavailable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 4: Exploratory Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "* Map break locations to visualize density/hotspots.\n",
    "* Analyze time trends (by year, month, or season).\n",
    "* Overlay enriched features to identify potential correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 5: Modeling & Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create classification labels:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Binary (e.g., hotspot vs. non-hotspot)\n",
    "  * Or frequency bands (low/med/high break zones)\n",
    "* Apply basic models:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Logistic regression\n",
    "  * Decision trees\n",
    "  * Random forest (as capacity allows)\n",
    "* Evaluate with confusion matrix, precision/recall, AUC.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 6: Dashboard (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Build a lightweight Flask dashboard to:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Display break heatmaps\n",
    "  * Show predictions across city zones\n",
    "  * Provide insight for hypothetical maintenance prioritization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initial Notes: Data Exploration Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The Syracuse water main break dataset is an open-access civic dataset with major limitations for ML. While it includes key fields such as break type and geolocation, it omits most engineering attributes necessary for classic infrastructure risk modeling:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Missing columns:** Pipe material, diameter, installation year, depth, surrounding soil, pressure, maintenance history, etc.\n",
    "* This forced a pivot: the project scope has shifted from predicting break likelihood at the *pipe level* to analyzing *spatial risk zones* using enriched public data and proxy features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the lack of pipe-specific data, the dataset still enables meaningful civic analysis â€” especially when combined with enrichment techniques. This reframing offers strong portfolio value and real-world applicability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "More detailed documentation will follow with exploratory visuals, data cleaning process, enrichment steps, and modeling logic.\n",
    "\n",
