    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This whitepaper explores the use of machine learning to predict water main breaks in aging municipal infrastructure. Using a real-world dataset from the City of Syracuse, NY—albeit with missing or incomplete metadata such as pipe age and material—we develop a pipeline for exploring spatial patterns and predicting break occurrences. Despite limited data, we demonstrate that useful insights can be generated through feature engineering, geospatial clustering, and classification modeling. This work aims to showcase how machine learning can support smarter maintenance planning for public utilities.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Aging infrastructure is a national concern, particularly with respect to buried assets like water mains. Municipalities often rely on reactive maintenance, leading to costly repairs and water loss. This project explores a predictive maintenance approach using machine learning to identify likely break locations—prioritizing limited resources where they’re needed most.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Most cities lack detailed, structured data on buried pipes (e.g., material, diameter, age). This limits the effectiveness of traditional statistical models. The Syracuse dataset provides break location and type, but not physical pipe attributes. Our goal is to determine whether useful predictions can still be made using location-based patterns and engineered features.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This study demonstrates a low-barrier entry point for cities to begin using machine learning to forecast water main failures. With minimal data, we’ve shown break patterns are detectable. As more data becomes available, this model can evolve to deliver even more accurate and actionable results.\n",

    "- Explore satellite or remote sensing to infer pipe locations and environments\n",
    "- Build a demo Flask dashboard to visualize break predictions\n",
    "- Expand to other cities using transfer learning or federated learning models\n",
