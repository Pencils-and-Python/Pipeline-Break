## Methodology

This section outlines our step-by-step approach for building the predictive model.

### Data Ingestion & Cleaning

We imported the raw dataset from the Syracuse Open Data Portal and filtered for relevant attributes.

### Feature Engineering

- Created spatial clusters using DBSCAN
- Extracted temporal features (season, day of week)
- Calculated break frequency per cluster

### Model Selection

We used a Random Forest Classifier due to its:<br>
- High interpretability,<br>
- Low computational cost,<br>
- Strong performance on small tabular datasets
